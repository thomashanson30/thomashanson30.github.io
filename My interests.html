<h1 style="font-size:40%;"><i><p>Throughout my life, I've always had a bunch of hobbies
and interests, such as; Playing sports, spending time outdoors, hanging out with
friends and family, watching movies, playing video games, and so on. </h1></p></p></i><font> 

<h1 style="font-size:40%;"><i><p>But being in college has allowed me to expand on hobbies 
I did not know I had. This year, I've really enjoyed meeting new 
people around campus, as well as making new friends. I've also enjoyed writing code in class,
as well as learning about the human mind in my other class.
